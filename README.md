# Tokenized Theater Production Investment (TTPI)

## Overview

The Tokenized Theater Production Investment (TTPI) platform provides a blockchain-based solution for funding, managing, and monetizing theatrical productions. By leveraging smart contracts, TTPI creates a transparent ecosystem for producers, investors, and theater professionals to verify projects, track investments, monitor performance metrics, and distribute revenue fairly and efficiently.

## Core Components

### Production Verification Contract
Validates legitimate theatrical projects through comprehensive documentation including creative team credentials, venue agreements, script rights, production budgets, and development timelines. Each verified production receives a unique blockchain identifier linked to its complete digital profile.

### Investment Management Contract
Tracks capital contributions and ownership stakes with precision and transparency. Records investment amounts, equity percentages, voting rights, and special terms. Creates tokenized ownership shares that can be securely transferred or traded according to predefined rules.

### Performance Tracking Contract
Records ticket sales, attendance figures, and other key performance metrics for each show. Creates an immutable record of performance history including dates, attendance rates, and sales information to provide investors with accurate production data.

### Revenue Distribution Contract
Automatically allocates income from successful shows according to predetermined investment agreements. Distributes revenue shares to investors, creative teams, venues, and other stakeholders based on contractual terms and performance triggers.
